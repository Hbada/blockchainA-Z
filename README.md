# Blockchain in progress
Code produced during code-along lessons during Blockchain A-Z course on udemy.com
I am not sure what happens next in the course. As my understanding improves, and as opportunities arise (if any) to modify and make the project my own, I'll update the info here to reflect it. 

Meanwhile GitHub is a convenient place to store the code so I can refer to it during live discussions about blockchains and Python, for example meetups and when tutoring others.
